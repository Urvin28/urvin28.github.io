      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>My name is Urvin Chandpara, and I graduated from Felician University in December 2025 with a bachelors degree in Business Analytics, maintaining a GPA of 3.8.

I was born and raised in a small town in India with big dreams, which shaped my work ethic, discipline, and determination. In high school, I competed in kickboxing and represented my state in two national games in the under-70 kg category, experiences that taught me resilience and consistency.

Outside of academics, I enjoy hiking, reading books, creating ML models and weightlifting. I am curious, motivated, and always looking for opportunities to grow personally and professionally.</p>
